        Player       &       0 & Player character. The player is a single entity and the sole 
                                 participant of this faction group.                           \\

        Enemy        &       1 & AI Agents that represent Enemies, which are hostile to the 
                                 player character.                                            \\

        NPC          &       2 & Non-Playable Characters. AI Agents which are not hostile to 
                                 the player character, but are hittable by and potentially 
                                 hostile to Enemies. An example of a Non-Playable Character 
                                 would be a companion which follows the player character and 
                                 aids them in combat encounters, being hostile to characters 
                                 belonging to the Enemy faction.                              \\

        Interactable &       3 & Static objects that can be attacked by the Player, Enemies or 
                                 Non-Player Characters and provide some type of feedback when 
                                 attacked. An example of an interactable entity would be a 
                                 barrel that can be attacked and destroyed.                   \\
