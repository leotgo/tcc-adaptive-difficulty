% WaypointMove   | Patrolling       | Uses a set of waypoints (which can be empty)
%                |                  | to move a character in fixed points on the
%                |                  | NavMesh of the environment.
% ---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------
% Scan           | Idle, Patrolling | Uses a set of collision triggers to detect
%                |                  | enemies of the AI agent in an area around or
%                |                  | in front of its position, and assigns a 
%                |                  | target upon detection.
% ---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------
% Seek           | Seeking          | Follows a target, constantly moving to its
%                |                  | position until the target is out of range.
% ---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------
% AdjustDistance | CombatMovement   | Adjusts the distance of the AI Agent to be
%                |                  | close enough to perform an attack, without
%                |                  | being too close to the target.
% ---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------
% PlanAttack     | CombatMovement   | Chooses the next attack based on the actions
%                |                  | being performed by the target, or by using
%                |                  | random number generation.
% ---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------
% Attack         | CombatMovement   | Performs the chosen attack on the target
%                |                  | using the Attack System pipeline.
% ---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------
% RotateAttack   | CombatMovement   | Performs body rotation to adjust the attack
%                |                  | to a moving target. The rotation has limited
%                |                  | speed to permit the target to dodge.
% ---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------
% Shoot          | Shooting         | Used by ranged enemies. Continuously shoot
%                |                  | arrows at a target until the target is
%                |                  | out of range.
% ---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------
% Death          | Dead             | Deactivates all components, triggers the
