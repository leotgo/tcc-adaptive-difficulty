\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

The cover for the first edition of the book \emph{Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools} (1985) depicted a Knight and a Red Dragon. The Dragon was meant to represent one of the great challenges of engineers in that era: taming the \emph{Compiler}. The field of Computer Science evolved throughout the decades, and the dragon changed its form many times. As any computer scientist chooses the dragon they battle against, I found my dragon to be manifested in the form of this work. With the help of my family, girlfriend and friends, here I tell the story of how I prevailed against my overwhelming self-disbelief.

I thank my mother, Angela, for her unrelenting support throughout the countless months where I refused to believe that I would be able to complete this work. I thank my girlfriend, Jessica, for reminding me that I had surpassed many challenges before this, and that this would be a difficult, but definite step towards achieving my lifelong goals. I thank my brother, Giovanni, for lending me his pragmatic views on the processes which would help me achieve my goals in this work. I thank my therapist, Joana, for lending me her eyes to realize that this work was not an unbeatable enemy, but a dragon which I strengthened through fear. I thank my advisor, Prof. Luciana Nedel, for allowing me to pursue a dangerous but personal objective as my final academic work. And I thank my friends, especially Alexander, Lucas, Monicque and Lorencetti for the company during this long journey, filled with defeat, anger, despair... but ultimately, blissful accomplishment.
